# finite-water-biomes
This datapack is designed to give a blacklist to LobsterJohn's Finite Water mod, in order to allow infinite water to regenerate in water biomes. The biomes I have chosen are:

*   ocean
*   deep ocean
*   cold ocean
*   deep cold ocean
*   frozen ocean
*   deep frozen ocean
*   lukewarm ocean
*   deep lukewarm ocean
*   warm ocean
*   river
*   frozen river

This datapack has only been tested on 1.20.1 on version 0.1.2 of LobsterJohn's mod. It does not work with 0.1.1 of the mod when played on 1.20.1. At the time of writing this (6th Dec 2024) you have to find this 0.1.2 version on Curseforge.
